- `web3`: Web3 client API for interacting with an ethereum node
- `web3-generator`: Generate purescript FFI for your solidity smart contracts
- `solc`: Wrapper for the solidity compiler (mostly for internal use in chanterelle)
- `chanterelle`: A CLI for deploying, managing, and testing smart contracts on Ethereum


### Previous work
All of these packages were previously listed in the [f-o-a-m](https://github.com/f-o-a-m) github org (no longer active). Since spago now allows for monorepo package management, I have greatly simplified the situation by consolidating everything here. All future work will be posted in this repository, the others are
no archived.
